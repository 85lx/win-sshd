A native win32 sshd.

Supports the sftp & exec subsystems only.


CAUTION - Use a real sshd in production!

This sshd is a fun hacking experience. Everything here (except the big integer code) is hand written. The crypto was implemented directly from the FIPS specs. The sshd was implemented against RFC-4250,4251,4252,4253 & 4254.

This is native win32 - no cygwin needed.
