A native win32 sshd.

Supports the sftp & exec subsystems only.


CAUTION

Use a real sshd in production. 

This sshd was just a fun hacking experience. Everything here (except the big integer code) is hand written. You really dont want to run this sshd on your system.
This is native win32 - no cygwin needed.
